# 🤖 Agentic AI Project

This project demonstrates an agentic AI system capable of creating prompt for 2D game object , creating image and object quality by comparing its prompt and image. 

This project is mainly focus on reducing time for designing game objects for our games. ( This kind of systems can be improved and used for game development companies ) 

Prompt engineering techniques such as zero shot , few shot, role-giving mechanism is tried to improve the accuracy of our project. 

/projectTrails folder contains some python files in order to understand concepts of OpenAI API. 

/project folder contains the last pyhton files that we need to run.
